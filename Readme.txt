Library for interfacing Arduino with TEA5757 Radio-on-chip IC

Philips TEA5757 is a (now obsolete) AM/FM radio-on-chip IC,
which was widely used on Philips’ (and other brands?)
middle-to-high-end sound systems.

TEA5757 is one of the easiest radios IC to communicate with 
(although it is not so easy to use as it demands a lot of 
external components).  It works really well and old 
TEA5757-based radio modules may be a good choice for 
someone wanting to play with AM/FM radio projects.
